The final portion of the Vedas is called Vedanta. Veda is a body of knowledge and is the primary means for knowing the true nature of oneself.  Vedanta points out the human goal and shows the path that leads to the goal. The first portion of the Veda deals mainly with ethics and rituals, while Vedanta imparts knowledge about the true nature of God, World and Beings. Vedanta reveals to us the imperishable nature of God, perishable nature of the world, and the essential oneness of God and Beings.
