The tradition of teaching Vedanta has a lineage of Teachers.  A few among those teachers, wrote independent texts based on the essence of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, for the benefit of seekers.  These texts are in simple style, in keeping with the times during which they were written.

The classes explaining some of these texts have been classified under Vedantic Texts.
