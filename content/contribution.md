Dear Students,

I am happy to note that all of you are benefitting by listening to the Classes recorded in our website “Poornalayam”. Having a mind which is keen to listen to Sastra is indeed a great blessing. My best wishes and blessings to all of you.

Our trust Poornalyam has now the necessary corpus fund to maintain its noble activities. As it is self sufficient enough and adequate, it is suggested that you may not send further donations to the trust.

With blessings,

Swami Guruparananda.
